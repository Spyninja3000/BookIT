# BookIT by Tejas Shah
FBLA Coding and Programming Challenge 2018
Chapter 14590

- The main product is the BookIT Application
	- go into the 'build' folder, then the 'exe.win-amd64-3.6' folder and click on 'BookIT' app
	- Will only run on Windows computers as an executable
	- All code/software is void of malware, viruses, trojans, etc. of any kind
	- There is an error on some computers (don't know what causes it) that makes the main window only
	  display the name and the refresh button. Should this happen and you want to see the whole final product, 
	  you MAY have to install Python 3.6 and run 'BookIT.py'. I've determined this error happens at random on
	  different computers, so I have no way of fixing it.
	- At the start, if you don't want to create your own excel files, use the default on by loading in
	  'Books.csv' and 'Users.csv' from 'build/exe.win-amd64-3.6'
- All pictures/icons/documents were developed by me
- All of the 'PY' or 'Python' files in the root folder are the programs that make up the project

Thank you for considering my project!
